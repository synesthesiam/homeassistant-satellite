# Deprecation Notice

**NOTE**: Work has moved to the [wyoming-satellite](https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming-satellite) project. This has better integration with Home Assistant, and is more modular with audio services.

---

## [DEPRECATED] Home Assistant Satellite

Python-based satellite for [Assist](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/) that streams audio to Home Assistant from a microphone.

You must have the [openWakeWord add-on](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?addon=47701997_openwakeword&repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Frhasspy%2Fhassio-addons) installed.


## Requirements

* Python 3.9 or higher
* ffmpeg
* alsa-utils (for `arecord` and `aplay`)


## Installation

Install Python and the required system dependencies:

``` sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-venv \
                     alsa-utils git

sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends \
                     ffmpeg
```

Clone the repository and run the setup script:

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/synesthesiam/homeassistant-satellite.git
cd homeassistant-satellite
script/setup
```

This will create a virtual environment and install the package.

## Long-Lived Access Token

You must create a long-lived access token in Home Assistant for the satellite to access the websocket API.

1. Go to your profile page in Home Assistant
2. Scroll down to "Long-lived access tokens"
3. Click "Create token"
4. Enter a name and click "OK"
5. Copy the **entire token** using the copy button provided
6. Save the token somewhere you can paste from later


## Running

``` sh
script/run --host <IP> --token <TOKEN>
```

where `<IP>` is the IP address of your Home Assistant server and `<TOKEN>` is the long-lived access token.

This will stream audio from the default microphone to your preferred pipeline in Home Assistant.

See `--help` for more options

### Feedback Sounds

Use `--awake-sound <WAV>` and `--done-sound <WAV>` to play sounds when the wake word is detected and when a voice command is finished.

For example:

``` sh
script/run ... --awake-sound sounds/awake.wav --done-sound sounds/done.wav
```

### Pipeline Name

The preferred pipeline will be run by default, but you change this with `--pipeline <NAME>` where `<NAME>` is the name of the pipeline you'd like to run instead.

### Change Microphone/Speaker

Run `arecord -L` to list available input devices. Pick devices that start with `plughw:` because they will perform software audio conversions. Use `--mic-device plughw:...` to use a specific input device.

Run `aplay -L` to list available output devices. Pick devices that start with `plughw:` because they will perform software audio conversions. Use `--snd-device plughw:...` to use a specific output device.

### Voice Activity Detection

For fast but inaccurate speech detection:

``` sh
.venv/bin/pip3 install .[webrtc]
```

and

``` sh
script/run ... --vad webrtcvad
```

For much better (but slower) speech detection, use [silero VAD](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad/) with:

``` sh
.venv/bin/pip3 install \
  --find-links https://synesthesiam.github.io/prebuilt-apps/ \
  .[silerovad]
```

and

``` sh
script/run ... --vad silero
```

**NOTE:** The `--find-links` option is only necessary on 32-bit ARM systems because Microsoft does not build `onnxruntime` wheels for them.

### Audio Enhancements

Make use of [webrtc-noise-gain](https://github.com/rhasspy/webrtc-noise-gain) with:

``` sh
.venv/bin/pip3 install .[webrtc]
```

Use `--noise-suppression <NS>` suppress background noise, such as fans (0-4 with 4 being max suppression, default: 0).

Use`--auto-gain <AG>` to automatically increase the microphone volume (0-31 with 31 being the loudest, default: 0).

Use`--volume-multiplier <VM>` to multiply volume by `<VM>` so 2.0 would be twice as loud (default: 1.0).

### Wake word detection via a direct wyoming connection

By default wake word detection is performed by forwarding audio to Home Assistant. It is also possible to perform wake word detection using a wyoming server,
possibly (but not necessarily) running on the same machine as the satellite.

First, ensure you have a wyoming server running. See
[Wyoming openWakeWord](https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming-openwakeword) for instructions.

To enable:
``` sh
.venv/bin/pip3 install .[wyoming]

script/run ... --wake-word wyoming
```

Use `--wyoming-host <host>` to set the host of the wyoming server (default `localhost`).

Use `--wyoming-port <port>` to set the port of the wyoming server (default `10400`).

Use `--wake-word-id <id>` to detect a specific wake word instead of the server's default.

### HTTPS

If your Home Assistant server uses https, you will need to add `--protocol https` to your command.


### PulseAudio / PipeWire

Enable [PulseAudio](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/) /
[PipeWire](https://pipewire.org/) support with:

``` sh
sudo apt-get install libpulse0

.venv/bin/pip3 install .[pulseaudio]
```

Use `--pulseaudio` to record and play audio via PulseAudio or PipeWire. A socket or hostname can be optionally provided as `--pulseaudio=<socket|host>`.

When using PulseAudio, ducking and acoustic echo cancelation are available to facilitate cases when the satellite is simultaneously used to play music, movies, etc. Such sounds are captured by the microphone, together with the user's voice, and interfere wake word detection and speech recognition.

`--echo-cancel` enables PulseAudio's acoustic echo cancelation, which removes playback sounds from the captured audio, making wake word detection easier.

`--ducking=<vol>` sets the volume of all playback streams to `<vol>` (e.g., `0.2` for 20%) after the wake word is detected and until the pipeline finishes, making speech recognition easier.


## Running as a Service

You can run homeassistant-satellite as a systemd service by first creating a service file:

``` sh
sudo systemctl edit --force --full homeassistant-satellite.service
```

Paste in the following template, and change both `/home/pi/homeassistant-satellite` and the `script/run` arguments to match your set up:

``` text
[Unit]
Description=Home Assistant Satellite
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/home/pi/homeassistant-satellite/script/run --host <host> --token <token>
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/homeassistant-satellite
Restart=always
RestartSec=1

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Save the file and exit your editor. Next, enable the service to start at boot and run it:

``` sh
sudo systemctl enable --now homeassistant-satellite.service
```

(you may need to hit CTRL+C to get back to a shell prompt)

With the service running, you can view logs in real-time with:

``` sh
journalctl -u homeassistant-satellite.service -f
```

Disable and stop the service with:

``` sh
sudo systemctl disable --now homeassistant-satellite.service
```

### Running in Docker

On the command-line:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
    --name 'homeassistant-satellite' \
    --device /dev/snd \
    --group-add=audio \
    ghcr.io/synesthesiam/homeassistant-satellite:latest \
    --host <HOST> \
    --token <TOKEN> \
    ...
```

Using Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  homeassistant-satellite:
    image: "ghcr.io/synesthesiam/homeassistant-satellite:latest"
    devices:
      - /dev/snd:/dev/snd
    group_add:
      - audio
    command:
      - --host
      - <HOST>
      - --token
      - <TOKEN>
```

It may be necessary to manually specify `--mic-device plughw:...` and `--snd-device plughw:...` when using Docker.

## Troubleshooting

Add `--debug` to get more information about the messages being exchanged with Home Assistant.

Add `--debug-recording-dir <DIR>` to save recorded audio to a directory `<DIR>`.
